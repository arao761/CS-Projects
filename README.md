Over the last three years, my journey into coding began with the basics: Java and HTML. Initially, my passion for web development and design guided me through creating visually appealing and functional websites. As time passed, my interests evolved, leading me toward the exciting realm of AI software development. Along this path, I've developed a solid understanding of Python and immersed myself in the fundamentals of machine learning.
